# FDF â€“ 3D Wireframe Landscape Viewer
A C project focused on rendering a wireframe model of a 3D landscape. Using the MiniLibX library, the program reads a .fdf file containing points in space and visualizes the corresponding 3D terrain in isometric projection.

# Features (Mandatory):
- Render 3D landscapes from .fdf files using isometric projection
- Smooth window and image management via MiniLibX
- Interactive: ESC or window close button quits cleanly
- Reads data efficiently using libft functions like get_next_line() and ft_split()
- No global variables allowed
- Fully compliant with Norm and memory-leak-free

# Bonus Features:
- Implement additional projections (parallel, conic, etc.)
- Zoom, translate, or rotate the model
- Add custom graphics enhancements

# Objective:
Learn the basics of graphics programming, coordinate mapping, and 3D visualization. This project introduces fundamental concepts of rendering, projection, and interactive window management in C.
