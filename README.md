# 42_projects
Hi! I’m Aleksei, currently studying at 42 Paris since May 2023. This repository is meant to gather and showcase all the projects I’ve been working on during my time at 42.

# Level 6
- **[ft_transcendence](https://github.com/kaierhyeh/ft_transcendence/tree/4c3d398803bd8af5c2bc0964b2456259dca7cd35)** - a fullstack project. Create online Ping-Pong game. Currently in progress.

# Level 5
- **[ft_irc](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/05_ft_irc)** A custom IRC server built in C++98, following the official IRC protocol. It allows multiple clients to connect via TCP/IP, authenticate, set nicknames, join channels, and exchange messages in real time. *(group project with [@vecherinca](https://github.com/vecherinca))*
- **[Inception](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/05_ft_Inception)** A system administration project focused on containerization with Docker Compose. The goal is to build and configure a complete infrastructure inside a virtual machine by writing your own Dockerfiles.
- **[CPP modules 05-09](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/CPP_modules)** A series of projects designed to progressively introduce and strengthen key C++ concepts. Each module focuses on a specific topic, combining theory with practical exercises to build a solid foundation in modern C++ programming.

# Level 4
- **[NetPractice](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/04_NetPractice)** An interactive project to learn and practice fundamental networking concepts through simulated exercises in a browser-based interface.
- **[cub3d](https://github.com/42mates/cub3D/tree/387635e847b4b4da37f397420e60d08cfbe9a820)** "Cub3D" is a 3D game developed in C using the MiniLibX graphics library, which emulates 3D textures using the raycasting technique. *(group project with [@marinsucks](https://github.com/marinsucks))*
- **[CPP modules 00-04](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/CPP_modules)** A series of projects designed to progressively introduce and strengthen key C++ concepts. Each module focuses on a specific topic, combining theory with practical exercises to build a solid foundation in modern C++ programming.

# Level 3
- **[minishell](https://github.com/42mates/minishell/tree/ffa4509646ccfdfe2c274b20a5be298a3aa4929a)** Minishell is a simplified version of a shell, implementing some of the basic functionalities of the Bash POSIX shell. It supports executing commands, handling environment variables, basic and managing processes. *(group project with [@marinsucks](https://github.com/marinsucks))*
- **[Philosophers](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/03_Philosophers/philo)** A concurrency project that explores multithreading, synchronization, and resource sharing through the classic dining philosophers problem.

# Level 2
- **[FdF](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/02_FdF)** A C project focused on rendering a wireframe model of a 3D landscape. Using the MiniLibX library, the program reads a .fdf file containing points in space and visualizes the corresponding 3D terrain in isometric projection.
- **[minitalk](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/02_minitalk)** A lightweight messaging program built in C, where a client and server communicate exclusively using UNIX signals (SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2).
- **[push_swap](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/02_push_swap)** A C program designed to sort integers using two stacks and a limited set of operations, aiming for the minimal number of instructions. This project emphasizes algorithmic thinking, optimization, and understanding the complexity of sorting.

# Level 1
- **[ft_printf](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/01_ft_printf)** A C project that involves recreating the functionality of the standard printf() function. This project focuses on handling variadic functions, proper formatting, and argument parsing, providing a deeper understanding of C internals and formatted output.
- **[Born2beroot](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/01_Born2beroot)** Born2beRoot is a system administration project designed to teach virtualization, server setup, and Linux security. You will create your first virtual machine (VM) in VirtualBox or UTM and configure it according to strict rules.
- **[get_next_line](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/01_get_next_line)** A C project focused on creating a function get_next_line() that reads a line from a file descriptor. This project teaches static variables, memory management, and efficient I/O handling.

# LEvel 0
- **[libft](https://github.com/ku-alexej/42_projects/tree/main/00_Libft)** Libft is a project where you reimplement standard C library functions and create your own general-purpose library. This foundational project helps you understand how common C functions work and prepares you for future assignments.
