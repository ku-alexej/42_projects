# Push_swap â€“ Stack Sorting Challenge
A C program designed to sort integers using two stacks and a limited set of operations, aiming for the minimal number of instructions. This project emphasizes algorithmic thinking, optimization, and understanding the complexity of sorting.

# Features (Mandatory):
- Sort a list of integers using stacks a and b
- Supported operations: sa, sb, ss, pa, pb, ra, rb, rr, rra, rrb, rrr
- Output is the shortest possible sequence of operations to sort stack a in ascending order
- Handles errors gracefully (invalid input, duplicates, out-of-range integers)
- No global variables allowed
- Fully compliant with Norm and memory leak free

# Bonus (Checker Program):
- Verifies sequences of instructions applied to stacks
- Displays OK if the stack is correctly sorted, KO otherwise
- Handles all errors properly

# Objective:
Learn algorithm optimization, stack operations, and develop efficient C code for minimal instruction sorting. Bonus rewards creating your own checker to verify solutions.
